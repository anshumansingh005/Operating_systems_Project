# Operating_systems_Project
This code is based on non pre-emptive scheduling similar to shortest job next nature.
Jobs gain higher priority they wait, which prevents indefinite postponement.
The priority can be computed as:
Priority = 1+ (Waiting time/Esimated time).

The Program will calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process and average waiting time and average turnaround time.
